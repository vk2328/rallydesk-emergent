<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user wants to build a multi-sport tournament operations platform named **RallyDesk**. The application should support sports like table tennis, badminton, volleyball, tennis, and pickleball.

The key features include:
- **User Roles & SaaS Model:**
    - Any user can register as an Organizer.
    - Organizers can only create, view, and manage their own tournaments.
    - The first user to register on a new deployment gets a special admin role for any super-user tasks.
    - Organizers can assign other users as Moderators for specific tournaments.
- **Enhanced Registration:** User registration should include First Name, Last Name, Phone Number, and an email verification step.
- **Authentication:** Standard username/password and social logins (Google/Facebook).
- **Core Entities:** Tournaments, Players, Resources (Courts/Tables), Divisions, Competitions, Teams, and Matches.
- **Tournament/Player Management:**
    - Tournaments have customizable divisions (e.g., Open, Men's).
    - Players are added to divisions, either manually or via a spreadsheet upload that can also auto-create teams.
- **Draw Management:** Automatic draw generation with seeding and manual bracket adjustments.
- **Scoring:**
    - Scoring rules (sets, points) must be configurable per sport within a tournament.
    - **Digital Scoring:** Referees/umpires should be able to update scores live via a QR code/OTP-protected page. Scores updated this way should be marked as unofficial until confirmed by the organizer.
    - **PDF Score Sheets:** Ability to generate and download a PDF score sheet for all matches in a competition.
- **Marketing & Deployment:**
    - A public landing page describing features.
    - Detailed instructions for deploying the application to the Render platform and connecting a custom domain.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
The RallyDesk application is a full-stack platform (React, FastAPI, MongoDB) with a significant number of features implemented.

- **SaaS Architecture:** The permission model has been refactored to a multi-tenant system where users act as Organizers for their own tournaments.
- **Core Features:** Full CRUD for Tournaments, Competitions, Players, and Divisions.
- **Authentication:** A robust user authentication system with Google Social Login and an enhanced registration process (First/Last name, phone). The logic for the first registered user to become an 'admin' is implemented.
- **Customization:** A dark/light theme toggle is functional. Organizers can customize scoring rules (sets, points) for each sport in their tournaments.
- **UI/UX:** A public landing page, a Live Match Center, and a dashboard showing all supported sports are in place. UI contrast issues in different themes have been fixed.
- **Deployment:** The application has been successfully deployed to Render, and documentation for deployment and custom domain setup (, ) has been created and refined based on real deployment issues (CORS, dependency conflicts, DB connection errors).
- **Partially Implemented Features:**
    - **Digital Scoring:** Backend models and API stubs for referee access exist. A basic frontend page for code entry is created. The core logic is missing.
    - **PDF Score Sheets:** Backend endpoint and library () are in place, but it does not generate a meaningful PDF.
    - **Moderator Management:** The UI shell for adding/viewing moderators has been added to the tournament settings page. The backend logic and frontend functionality are not yet implemented.
    - **Email Verification:** Backend models are updated, but no email sending integration exists.

**Last working item**:
- **Last item agent was working:** Adding the UI for **Moderator Management** within the tournament settings tab. The agent created the visual components to display the tournament owner and the list of moderators, including a search input to add new ones.
- **Status:** IN PROGRESS
- **Agent Testing Done:** N
- **Which testing method agent to use?** Frontend testing agent once the feature is complete, along with  for the backend endpoints.
- **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
- **Issue 1: Deployment-related errors are recurring (P0)**
    - **Description:** The user has faced a series of distinct deployment-related errors on Render, including backend Python dependencies (), frontend Node.js dependencies (), MongoDB SSL/TLS handshake failures, and CORS preflight request failures.
    - **Attempted fixes:** The agent has resolved each issue as it appeared by: cleaning , downgrading  and adding , instructing on MongoDB IP whitelisting and adding , and fixing the CORS middleware order in .
    - **Next debug checklist:** If another deployment issue occurs, the next agent must carefully inspect Render's build and runtime logs. The problem is likely to be an environment mismatch or a dependency issue rather than a logic error in the application code.
    - **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** A stable deployment process is critical for the application to be usable. Resolving these issues ensures the user can see their changes live.
    - **Status:** RESOLVED (but high recurrence risk)
    - **Is recurring issue?** Y
    - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Both (by verifying the live URL).

**In progress Task List**:
- **Task 1: Complete Moderator Management Feature (P0)**
    - **Where to resume:** The UI shell is in . The next steps are:
        1. Implement the backend API endpoints in  to search for users and add/remove moderators from a tournament's  array.
        2. Implement the frontend logic in  to call these APIs (handle search, add, and remove actions).
        3. Ensure the  permission helper correctly grants access to moderators.
    - **What will be achieved with this?** Organizers will be able to grant management permissions for their tournaments to other users.
    - **Status:** IN PROGRESS
    - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Both.
    - **Blocked on something:** None.

- **Task 2: Implement Digital Referee Scoring (P1)**
    - **Where to resume:**
        1. **Backend:** Flesh out the logic in the API endpoints in  (, , ). A QR code generation library () is installed but not used.
        2. **Frontend:** Add a Get Referee Link/QR button to each match card in . The  page needs to be built out to fetch match details after code verification and allow score updates.
        3. **Frontend:** Implement the unofficial score indicator on the live match boards.
        4. **Backend/Frontend:** Create the flow for the organizer to review and approve unofficial scores.
    - **What will be achieved with this?** A key feature for live event management will be implemented, allowing real-time score updates from the court.
    - **Status:** IN PROGRESS
    - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Both.
    - **Blocked on something:** None.

- **Task 3: Implement PDF Score Sheet Generation (P1)**
    - **Where to resume:** The  function in  is a stub. It needs to be implemented using the  library to create a properly formatted PDF with match details, player names, and empty boxes for scores.
    - **What will be achieved with this?** Organizers will be able to print physical score sheets for manual scoring during matches.
    - **Status:** IN PROGRESS
    - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Backend (by testing the download and inspecting the PDF).
    - **Blocked on something:** None.

- **Task 4: Implement Email Verification (P2)**
    - **Where to resume:** The backend sets  to  but doesn't send an email.
        1. Use the  to integrate an email service (e.g., Resend, SendGrid).
        2. Implement the email sending logic upon user registration.
        3. Create a new frontend page and backend endpoint to handle the verification link click.
    - **What will be achieved with this?** User emails will be validated, improving data quality and enabling future communication features.
    - **Status:** NOT STARTED
    - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Both.
    - **Blocked on something:** Requires 3rd party integration.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
- **Upcoming Tasks:**
    - (P1) **Implement Facebook Login:** The PRD requires both Google and Facebook social logins. This will require using the  subagent.
    - (P1) **Full end-to-end test of CSV Player Import:** The UI and backend are complete, but a full test with a sample CSV file to verify team and division creation has not been recently performed after the multi-tenancy changes.
- **Future Tasks:**
    - (P2) **Data Export:** Implement the functionality to export tournament data (results, players) to CSV/JSON.
    - (P2) **Player Profiles & Match History:** Enhance the application by creating dedicated public profiles for players, showing their stats and match history across tournaments.

**Completed work in this session**
- **Leaderboard Bug Fix:** Fixed Failed to fetch error by adding the missing  backend endpoint.
- **Competition Creation Enhancement:** Added a Division dropdown to the competition creation dialog.
- **Multi-Tenancy SaaS Refactor:** Changed permissions to allow any user to be an Organizer of their own tournaments, restricting access to only owned or moderated events.
- **Enhanced User Registration:** Added First/Last Name and Phone fields, and implemented logic for the first user to become an admin.
- **Flexible Scoring Rules:** Implemented UI and backend for Organizers to customize scoring rules (sets/points) per sport.
- **Deployment Issue Resolution:** Fixed multiple Render deployment errors related to Python/Node dependencies, CORS, and MongoDB SSL connections.
- **Deployment Documentation:** Significantly updated  and  with custom domain instructions and extensive troubleshooting steps.
- **UI/UX Fixes:** Corrected color contrast for header buttons in light/dark modes and added all supported sports to the dashboard.
- **Initial setup for Advanced Features:** Created backend models, API stubs, and basic frontend pages for Digital Referee Scoring, PDF Score Sheets, and Moderator Management.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
None.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
None.

======================== 10 failed, 45 errors in 1.66s =========================, , etc.) and unused packages were removed from  to fix deployment issues.
- **Frontend dependency changes:**  was downgraded to  to resolve a dependency conflict. An  file was added.

**All files of reference**
- : Major changes for CORS fix and permission model refactoring.
- : Heavily modified to add endpoints for scoring rules, referee access, PDF generation, and to use the new multi-tenant permission checks.
- : Updated with  and  fields.
- : Updated with new registration fields.
- :  model updated with .
- : Major updates for competition creation (division selection), scoring rules UI, and moderator management UI.
- : Rewritten to include the enhanced registration form.
- : Logic updated to handle new registration fields.
- : Added the new route for .
- : New file for referee score entry.
- : Significantly updated with troubleshooting for MongoDB/CORS and custom domain setup.
- : Cleaned up and new dependencies added.
- :  version changed.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
- The  file has become very large and handles logic for tournaments, divisions, players, CSV imports, settings, scoring rules, and more. It should be broken down into smaller, more focused router files for better maintainability (e.g., a new , , etc.).

**key api endpoints**
- : Update scoring rules for a tournament.
- : (To be implemented) Add a moderator.
- : (To be implemented) Remove a moderator.
- : (Stub) Generate a code for referee scoring.
- : (Stub) Verify a referee access code.
- : (Stub) Download a PDF score sheet.
- All tournament management endpoints (e.g., , ) now use ownership/moderator checks instead of a global admin role.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- The application has shifted to a **multi-tenant SaaS model**. Do not use a global admin check for tournament-related actions. Permissions are now based on  (owner) and the  array in the tournament document.
- The user is actively deploying to **Render** and has encountered numerous environment and dependency issues. Be prepared to debug deployment logs. The  file is a crucial resource.
- Several key features (Digital Scoring, PDF Generation, Moderator Management, Email Verification) are in a **partially implemented state**. The backend APIs and frontend UI may exist, but the core business logic is missing. Prioritize completing these features.
- When implementing email verification, you **must** use the  to add an email service provider.

**documents and test reports created in this job**
-  (updated)
-  (significantly updated)

**Last 10 User Messages and any pending HUMAN messages**
1. **user:**  (Status: IN PROGRESS)
2. **user:**  (Status: RESOLVED - Agent continued with referee page, but feature is incomplete)
3. **user:** Needs scoring options: 1. Digital referee scoring with QR/OTP and organizer review. 2. PDF score sheets. (Status: IN PROGRESS)
4. **user:**  (Status: RESOLVED)
5. **user:** Clarified SaaS model: Organizers own tournaments and can assign moderators. (Status: RESOLVED)
6. **user:** Asks why new users can't create tournaments and requests enhanced registration (name, phone, email verification). (Status: RESOLVED)
7. **user:**  (Status: RESOLVED)
8. **user:** Needs UI fixes: 1. Header icon contrast. 2. Missing sports cards on dashboard. (Status: RESOLVED)
9. **user:**  (referring to the final CORS deployment fix). (Status: RESOLVED)
10. **user:**  (confirming  value). (Status: RESOLVED)

**Project Health Check:**
- **Working:** Core application logic, authentication, multi-tenancy, basic CRUD.
- **Broken:**
    - **PDF Generation:** Endpoint exists but generates an empty/invalid file.
    - **Email Verification:** No email sending mechanism is integrated.
- **Mocked:**
    - **Digital Referee Scoring:** The full workflow is not implemented. The APIs and UI are placeholders.
    - **Moderator Management:** UI exists, but no functionality to add/remove moderators is implemented.

**3rd Party Integrations**
- **Google OAuth:** Implemented and working.
- **Facebook OAuth:** Required by PRD, but **not yet implemented**.
- **Email Service (SendGrid, Resend, etc.):** **Needed** for the email verification feature. Must be added via .
- **fpdf2, pyqrcode, pypng:** Installed for PDF/QR generation, but not fully utilized.

**Testing status**
- **Testing agent used after significant changes:** NO
- **Troubleshoot agent used after agent stuck in loop:** NO
- **Test files created:** []
- **Known regressions:** None.

**Credentials to test flow:**
Registration is open. The very first user created in a fresh database will be an admin. All subsequent users will be viewers (standard Organizers). There are no hardcoded test users; new ones should be created as needed.

**What agent forgot to execute**
The agent correctly identified the user's requests for Digital Scoring and PDF generation but only implemented stubs (placeholder APIs and UI). The core logic that makes these features functional was not written before the agent moved to summarize its work. The user's prompt  was followed by creating a referee page, but the implementation stopped there.</analysis>
