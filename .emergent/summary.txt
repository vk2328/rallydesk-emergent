<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user wants to build a multi-sport tournament operations platform named **RallyDesk**. The application should support sports like table tennis, badminton, volleyball, tennis, and pickleball.

The detailed requirements are provided in a comprehensive Product Requirements Document (PRD). The key features include:
- **User Roles:** Admin, Scorekeeper, Viewer, and a public-facing view.
- **Authentication:** Standard username/password and social logins (Google/Facebook).
- **Core Entities:** Tournaments, Players, Resources (Courts/Tables), Divisions, Competitions, Teams, and Matches.
- **Tournament/Player Management:**
    - Tournaments have different divisions (e.g., Open, Men's), which are created by the organizer.
    - Players are added to divisions, either manually or via a spreadsheet upload.
    - The spreadsheet import should automatically create teams if a 'team' column has a value.
- **Draw Management:**
    - Provide the capability for automatic draw generation (with seeding) and manual adjustments.
    - Support bracket progression for playoffs until the finals.
- **Marketing:**
    - Create a landing page describing the features and showing a high-level flow diagram.
- **Deployment:**
    - Provide instructions for deploying the application to the Render platform.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
The RallyDesk application is a feature-rich, full-stack platform (React, FastAPI, MongoDB) that has been built from the ground up. Most of the core requirements from the PRD are implemented and stable.

This includes:
- Full CRUD for Tournaments, Competitions, Players, and Resources.
- A functional user authentication system with roles (Admin, Viewer, Scorekeeper) and Google Social Login.
- A dark/light theme toggle.
- A public, real-time Live Match Center dashboard.
- A professional landing page.
- **Division Management:** Organizers can create, view, and delete divisions within a tournament.
- **Player-to-Division Association:** Players are now associated with specific divisions.
- **Enhanced CSV Import:** The CSV player import functionality now supports assigning players to a default division, overriding the division per row, and automatically creating teams based on a 'team' column.
- **Advanced Draw Generation:** The system supports automatic draw generation with seeding options (Random, Rating-based) and allows for manual adjustments to the bracket, including swapping participants and manually advancing winners.

**Last working item**:
*   **Last item agent was working:** The user asked for deployment documentation after confirming the app seemed production-ready. The agent created a  for general project setup and a  file with detailed instructions for deploying the application on Render. The agent was about to present these documents to the user.
*   **Status:** USER VERIFICATION PENDING
*   **Agent Testing Done:** N/A
*   **Which testing method agent to use?** N/A (Documentation task)
*   **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
There are no known bugs or technical issues. The primary pending item is for the user to review the deployment documentation that was just created.

**In progress Task List**:
*   **Task 1: Present Deployment Documentation to User (P0)**
    *   **Where to resume:** The files  and  have been created. The agent needs to show the contents of these files to the user to answer their question, where is the setup documentation.
    *   **What will be achieved with this?** The user's request for deployment instructions will be fulfilled.
    *   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
    *   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** N/A
    *   **Blocked on something:** None

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
*   **Upcoming Tasks:**
    *   (P1) **Implement Facebook Login:** The PRD requires both Google and Facebook social logins. This will require using the  subagent.
    *   (P1) **Full end-to-end test of CSV Player Import:** The UI and backend are complete, but a full test with a sample CSV file to verify team and division creation has not been performed.
*   **Future Tasks:**
    *   (P2) **Data Export:** Implement the functionality to export tournament data (results, players) to CSV/JSON as specified in the PRD.
    *   (P2) **Player Profiles & Match History:** Enhance the application by creating dedicated public profiles for players, showing their stats and match history across tournaments.
